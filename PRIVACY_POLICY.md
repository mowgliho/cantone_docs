Thanks for using Cantone!

As someone who takes privacy very seriously (to the extend that I try to pay in cash whenever possible), I also take your privacy seriously as well. As such, this app

* does not collect personally identifiable information.
* stores any data that you create (e.g. preferences, settings, etc.) on the device only - this can be erased through uninstallation.
* No audio that the app records (e.g. calibration, attempts etc.) is stored or uploaded anywhere.

If you find any issues or have any questions, please send an email to cantone.app@gmail.com

Thanks!
