Thanks for using Cantone!

As someone who takes privacy very seriously, I take your privacy seriously as well. As such, 

* The app does not store any personally identifiable information.
* Any data that you create (except as in the next point) are stored on the device only and can be erased through uninstallation.
* The only case where we transfer data off your phone is if "Enhanced Pitch Detection" is enabled.
  * In this case, "Try" attempts are processed on our server.
  * We do not store data any longer than is necessary (at most a few seconds).
  * You can opt-out of this by simply disabling this feature.

If you find any issues or have any questions, please send an email to cantone.app@gmail.com

Thanks again!
