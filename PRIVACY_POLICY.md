Thanks for using Cantone!

As someone who takes privacy very seriously, I take your privacy seriously as well. As such, 

* The app does not store any personally identifiable information.
* You can opt out of any and all data collection without changing your in-app experience.
* All data that may be collected is encrypted in transit.
* None of your data is shared with third parties.

Data that can be collected:

* Enhanced Pitch Detection (as of 1.0.6):
  * If enabled, your tone speaking attempts are processed on our server. This allows us to use a much better pitch detection algorithm.
  * Data is "processed ephemerally" (we do not store data any longer than is necessary - at most a few seconds).
  * You can opt-out by disabling this feature in "Settings => Enhanced Pitch Detection".
* Learn Results (as of 1.1.0):
  * To improve how we decide to show you which tasks and when, we collect data on your usage and the tasks that you complete.
  * This also allows us to let you see "Learn Ranking" compared to other users.
  * For this, data is stored on our server and not shared with any third parties.
  * You can opt-out by disabling this feature in "Settings => Upload Learn Results".

If you find any issues, have any questions, or would like to delete any data that may have been collected, please send an email to cantone.app@gmail.com.

Thanks again!
